<blockquote>Sonia is a conscientious person who works well under pressure. Her efficiency enables her to complete her tasks on time despite the tight deadlines. She demonstrates good ability in producing quality work. In addition, her optimism at work certainly rubs off on her colleagues. She also communicates well with her seniors when in doubt. It was a pleasure working with her.</blockquote>

### Eleen Goh | Regional Marketing Manager at Thermo Fisher Scientific

<blockquote>Sonia is a quick learner, with an excellent ability to apply new skills with minimal assistance or supervision. She grasped the marketing operation mechanism within the group in a short timeframe and is able to effectively contribute and even add on new ideas and suggestions for improvement. She is dependable and showed dedication on several projects such as the Cell Imaging Contest, which she single handedly managed with minimal assistance. Sonia has been an asset to the team and I would recommend her without reservation.</blockquote>

### Haw Siang Brandon Ang | Regional Product Manager at Thermo Fisher Scientific

<blockquote>Sonia and I worked on marketing strategies to promote the Thermo Fisher Cloud and deliver key features and capabilities of the cloud to the market. Sonia is always very fast in grasping the key elements of global strategies and she is very creative in delivering localized tactics. For example, she suggested many programs that were well accepted by the global team and most of her tactics worked! Sonia is a diligent, creative and caring team player.</blockquote>
