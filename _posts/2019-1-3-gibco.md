		<p>Thermo Fisher Scientific kicked off the Gibco & Nunc Summer Fiesta outreach program at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Biopolis Singapore as part of our outreach efforts to inform researchers and provide them with the option of purchasing the NUNC cell culture plastics.</p>

		<p>Inspired by our tropical weather, the summer-themed event was attended by over 300 customers who had the opportunity to view the new GIBCO + NUNC cell culture plastics and Invitrogen EVOS M5000 cell imaging system featured at our push carts.</p>

		<p>To encourage participation and boost overall interaction with our customers, activities were organized throughout the event. To snag exclusive Thermo Fisher merchandises, customers took part on our Instagram contest where they were required to take a photo with our giant NUNC plastic inflatables and post their best shot online tagging @gibcocellculture.and using the hashtag #BetterTogether</p>
