		<p>In Biopolis Singapore, Thermo Fisher piloted the launch of the new MiniAmp Thermal Cycler and AmpliFly program, which transported over 200 passengers through a sea of activities. These activities highlighted the new instrument MiniAmp as well as celebrated 30 years of thermal cycler innovation since 1987.</p>

		<p>Two other road shows were held at Nanyang Technological University and National University of Singapore and were also well received. Over 400 leads were garnered from the AmpliFly roadshow series across three customer sites. More than 31 MiniAmp Plus Thermal Cyclers were sold and the campaign generated over S$160,000 in revenue.</p>
